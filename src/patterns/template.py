# A template pattern defines a basic algorithm in a base class using abstract operation where subclasses override the concrete behavior. The template pattern keeps the outline of algorithm in a separate method. This method is referred as the template method.
#
# Following are the different features of the template pattern âˆ’
#
#     It defines the skeleton of algorithm in an operation
#
#     It includes subclasses, which redefine certain steps of an algorithm.
